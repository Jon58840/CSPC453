NOTES:

This is incomplete.

The orbital camera does not seem to function properly. Near the top if the constant variable orbitalCamera is flipped from false to true and the file is remade you can try and use the orbital camera. The shapes seem to behave oddly in unexpected ways though.

The textures do not work. Attempts were made and some of the leftover code can be seen, but random colours were used instead.

While the spheres orbit, they do so at an inconsistent pace. While the camera is moving in any manner, either through keyboard or mouse controls then they will move smoothly. When the window is left alone by itself they seem to move very slowly and jerkily.
